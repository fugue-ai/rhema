**Transform implicit knowledge into explicit, persistent context that survives across AI conversations and development sessions.**

Rhema (/Ààre…™m…ô/ "RAY-muh") is a Git-native toolkit that captures, organizes, and shares project knowledge through structured YAML files. It solves the fundamental problem of ephemeral context in AI-assisted development by making implicit knowledge explicit and persistent.



The name Rhema comes from the Greek word ·ø•·øÜŒºŒ±, meaning "utterance" or "that which is spoken." Just as rhema represents the ephemeral nature of spoken knowledge, Rhema captures the ephemeral nature of development knowledge‚Äîthose crucial insights, decisions, and context that exist in conversations, code reviews, and AI interactions but are often lost when the moment passes. By transforming these transient "utterances" of development wisdom into persistent, structured records, Rhema ensures that valuable knowledge endures beyond the immediate conversation or development session.

## Core Values

Rhema is built on fundamental principles that guide every aspect of its design and functionality. These values shape how we approach knowledge management, team collaboration, and AI integration.

### ü§ù Collaborative Knowledge

**Knowledge is a team asset, not an individual possession.**

Rhema breaks down knowledge silos by making context discoverable and shareable across your entire organization. Every team member can contribute to and benefit from the collective understanding of your codebase.

### üéØ AI-First, Universal Design

**Context should be optimized for AI consumption, human reading, and traditional machines.**

Rhema structures knowledge in ways that AI agents can effectively query, understand, and act upon. This enables consistent, context-aware AI behavior across all your development tools and conversations. In a tradeoff between human and traditional machine interactions, YAML is used as alternative to the traditional use of Markdown.

### üéØ Explicit Over Implicit

**Rhema's fundamental value proposition is making implicit knowledge explicit and persistent.**

**Before Rhema:** Knowledge exists in individual minds, temporary chats, and scattered docs, leading to knowledge silos and inconsistent AI behavior.

**After Rhema:** Knowledge is structured, persistent, and discoverable across your entire team and AI interactions.

### üìà Continuous Learning

**Knowledge should accumulate and improve over time, not degrade.**

Rhema preserves the full history of decisions, learnings, and patterns, allowing teams to build upon past insights rather than repeating the same discoveries. Context becomes a living, growing asset.

### üîç Discoverable Truth

**The right information should find you, not require you to find it.**

Rhema's powerful querying capabilities ensure that relevant context surfaces when and where it's needed. Whether through structured queries, full-text search, or AI-driven recommendations, knowledge flows to where it creates the most value.
