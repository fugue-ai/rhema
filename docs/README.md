# Rhema Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for the Rhema project, now built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local Development

1. Install the documentation dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Building for Production

To build the documentation for production:
