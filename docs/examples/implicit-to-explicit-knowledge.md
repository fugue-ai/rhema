# From Implicit to Explicit Knowledge

This example demonstrates how Rhema transforms scattered, ephemeral knowledge into structured, persistent context that survives across AI conversations and development sessions.

## 🎯 The Problem: Lost Context

In traditional development workflows, critical knowledge exists in:

- **Individual minds** - Developer memories and experiences
- **Temporary chats** - AI conversations that disappear
- **Scattered docs** - Unstructured, stale documentation
- **Forgotten decisions** - Architectural choices with lost rationale

This creates **knowledge silos**, **session amnesia**, and **inconsistent AI behavior** across your team.

## 💡 The Rhema Solution

Rhema transforms ephemeral knowledge into **persistent, structured context** that:

- **🔄 Survives sessions** - Context persists across AI conversations and development sessions
- **👥 Scales with teams** - Knowledge is shared and discoverable across your organization  
- **📈 Evolves with code** - Context changes are tracked alongside code in Git
- **🎯 Enables consistency** - AI agents access the same structured context
- **⚡ Accelerates onboarding** - New team members quickly understand project context

## 📋 Before Rhema (Implicit Knowledge)

```
Developer A: "I remember we decided to use PostgreSQL for the user service..."
Developer B: "Wait, when was that decided? I thought we were using MongoDB."
AI Agent: "Based on the code I can see, I recommend using Redis for caching..."
Developer C: "Actually, we already tried Redis and it caused issues with our deployment."
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ **Session amnesia** - AI agents don't remember past decisions
- ❌ **Team misalignment** - Different developers have different understandings
- ❌ **Lost knowledge** - Critical insights disappear when team members change
- ❌ **Inconsistent recommendations** - AI agents make conflicting suggestions

## ✨ After Rhema (Explicit Knowledge)

### Decisions File
```yaml
# .rhema/decisions.yaml
decisions:
  - id: "decision-001"
    title: "Use PostgreSQL for user service"
    description: "Chosen for ACID compliance and existing team expertise"
    status: "approved"
    date: "2024-01-15"
    rationale: "MongoDB lacks ACID transactions needed for user data integrity"
    alternatives_considered: ["MongoDB", "MySQL"]
    impact: "Affects user-service, auth-service, and payment-service"
```

### Knowledge File
```yaml
# .rhema/knowledge.yaml
insights:
  performance:
    - finding: "Redis caching caused deployment issues"
      impact: "Service startup failures in containerized environment"
      solution: "Use in-memory caching with periodic persistence"
      confidence: "high"
      evidence: ["Deployment logs", "Performance metrics"]
      related_files: ["src/cache.rs", "docker-compose.yml"]
```

## 🎉 Results

- ✅ **Session continuity** - AI agents know about the PostgreSQL decision and Redis issues
- ✅ **Team alignment** - Everyone has access to the same explicit context
- ✅ **Faster onboarding** - New developers can quickly understand past decisions
- ✅ **Consistent recommendations** - AI agents make recommendations based on explicit knowledge
- ✅ **Knowledge preservation** - Critical insights aren't lost when team members change

## 🔍 Querying the Context

Once knowledge is explicit, you can query it:

```bash
# Find all approved decisions
rhema query "decisions WHERE status='approved'"

# Find performance insights
rhema query "knowledge.insights.performance"

# Find decisions affecting multiple services
rhema query "decisions WHERE impact CONTAINS 'multiple'"
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Start small** - Begin by recording your next architectural decision
- **Build incrementally** - Add knowledge as you discover insights
- **Query regularly** - Use CQL to find and leverage existing context
- **Share with team** - Commit context files to version control
