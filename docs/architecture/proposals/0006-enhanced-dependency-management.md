# Enhanced Dependency Management


**Proposal**: Extend Rhema's dependency management from basic parent/child/peer relationships to include semantic dependency types, impact analysis, and advanced dependency tracking capabilities.

## Problem Statement


### Current Limitations


- **Basic Relationship Types**: Current dependency model only supports simple parent/child/peer relationships

- **Limited Impact Analysis**: No way to understand the full impact of changes across the dependency graph

- **Missing Semantic Context**: Dependencies lack semantic meaning (data flow, API calls, infrastructure)

- **No Failure Impact Assessment**: Cannot assess the business impact of service failures

- **Limited Dependency Validation**: No validation of dependency health or availability

### Business Impact


- **Deployment Risks**: Changes can break dependent services without warning

- **Incident Response**: Difficult to assess impact during outages

- **Capacity Planning**: No visibility into resource dependencies

- **Change Management**: Limited understanding of change impact across the system

## Proposed Solution


### High-Level Approach


Extend the current dependency model to include:

1. **Semantic Dependency Types**: Categorize dependencies by purpose and criticality

2. **Impact Analysis Engine**: Calculate and track impact across the dependency graph

3. **Health Monitoring Integration**: Real-time dependency health tracking

4. **Failure Impact Assessment**: Business impact analysis for dependency failures

5. **Advanced Validation**: Comprehensive dependency validation and conflict detection

### Key Components


- **Enhanced Schema Extensions**: New dependency types and metadata

- **Impact Analysis Engine**: Graph-based impact calculation

- **Health Check Integration**: Real-time dependency monitoring

- **Validation Framework**: Advanced dependency validation rules

- **CLI Commands**: New commands for dependency management and analysis

## Core Components


### 1. Enhanced Schema Extensions


#### Semantic Dependency Types


```yaml
dependencies:
  semantic:
    data_dependencies:

      - scope: "../user-service"
        type: "data_flow"
        criticality: "high"
        description: "User profile data required for authentication"
        data_contract:
          schema: "user_profile_v1"
          fields: ["id", "email", "profile", "preferences"]
          volume: "high"
          latency_requirement: "near_real_time"
    
    api_dependencies:

      - scope: "../auth-service"
        type: "service_call"
        criticality: "medium"
        description: "Authentication validation service"
        endpoints:

          - path: "/auth/validate"
            method: "POST"
            expected_response_time: "100ms"
            retry_policy: "exponential_backoff"

          - path: "/auth/refresh"
            method: "POST"
            expected_response_time: "50ms"
    
    infrastructure_dependencies:

      - scope: "../database-service"
        type: "persistence"

        description: "Secret and key management"
        required_secrets: ["database_password", "api_keys"]
        rotation_policy: "90_days"
```

#### Impact Analysis Configuration


```yaml
impact_analysis:
  upstream_services:

    - name: "frontend-app"
      type: "user_interface"
      criticality: "high"
      failure_impact: "user_experience_degradation"

  downstream_services:

    - name: "notification-service"
      type: "communication"
      criticality: "medium"
      failure_impact: "user_notification_failure"

    - name: "analytics-service"
      type: "reporting"
      criticality: "low"
      failure_impact: "reporting_delay"
  
  business_impact:
    failure_impact: "high"
    recovery_time: "5 minutes"
    cost_per_minute: "$1000"

```

### 2. Impact Analysis Engine


#### Graph-Based Impact Calculation


```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]


pub struct DependencyImpact {
    pub scope_id: String,
    pub impact_level: ImpactLevel,
    pub affected_services: Vec<String>,
    pub business_impact: BusinessImpact,
    pub recovery_plan: RecoveryPlan,
    pub mitigation_strategies: Vec<String>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]


pub enum ImpactLevel {
    None,
    Low,
    Medium,
    High,
    Critical,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]


pub struct BusinessImpact {
    pub cost_per_minute: f64,
    pub customer_impact: String,
    pub sla_breach_threshold: Duration,
    pub compliance_impact: Vec<String>,
}
```

#### Impact Analysis Algorithms


```rust
impl DependencyGraph {
    pub fn calculate_impact(&self, scope_id: &str) -> DependencyImpact {
        let mut impact = DependencyImpact::default();
        
        // Calculate direct impact
        let direct_deps = self.get_direct_dependencies(scope_id);
        impact.impact_level = self.assess_direct_impact(&direct_deps);
        
        // Calculate transitive impact
        let transitive_deps = self.get_transitive_dependencies(scope_id);
        impact.affected_services = self.collect_affected_services(&transitive_deps);
        
        // Calculate business impact
        impact.business_impact = self.calculate_business_impact(&impact.affected_services);
        
        // Generate recovery plan
        impact.recovery_plan = self.generate_recovery_plan(scope_id);
        
        impact
    }
    
    pub fn detect_circular_dependencies(&self) -> Vec<CircularDependency> {
        // Tarjan's algorithm for detecting strongly connected components
        self.tarjan_algorithm()
    }
    
    pub fn validate_dependency_health(&self) -> Vec<HealthIssue> {
        // Validate all dependencies against health checks
        self.validate_health_checks()
    }
}
```

### 3. CLI Commands
