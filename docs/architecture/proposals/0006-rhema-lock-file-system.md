# Rhema Lock File System


**Proposal ID**: 0006  
**Status**: ‚ùå **Not Started**  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 4-6 weeks  
**Timeline**: Q1 2025  

## üìã Executive Summary


This proposal introduces a lock file system for Rhema that provides deterministic dependency resolution across scopes, ensuring consistent context for AI agents and reproducible builds. The lock file will address the current gaps in dependency management by providing version pinning, conflict resolution, and build reproducibility.

## üéØ Problem Statement


### Current Limitations


Rhema's current dependency management system has several critical gaps:

1. **Non-deterministic Resolution**: Multiple scopes can reference different versions of the same dependency

2. **Version Conflicts**: No mechanism to resolve version conflicts between scopes

3. **Build Reproducibility**: Different environments may resolve dependencies differently

4. **AI Agent Coordination**: Agents working on different scopes may have inconsistent context

5. **Performance**: Dependency resolution is recalculated on every operation

### Impact on AI Agent Workflows


The lack of deterministic dependency resolution directly impacts Rhema's core goal of solving the **goal collaboration problem**:

- **Context Inconsistency**: AI agents may work with different versions of shared knowledge

- **Conflict Generation**: Agents may make decisions based on outdated or conflicting information

- **Session Fragmentation**: Context may change between agent sessions

- **Coordination Failures**: Agents cannot reliably coordinate when dependencies are unstable

## üöÄ Proposed Solution


### Lock File Architecture


The Rhema lock file system will introduce a `rhema.lock` file that provides:

1. **Deterministic Dependency Resolution**: Exact version pinning for all dependencies

2. **Cross-Scope Consistency**: All scopes reference the same versions of shared dependencies

3. **Build Reproducibility**: Guaranteed consistent resolution across environments

4. **Performance Optimization**: Pre-computed dependency graph for faster operations

5. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of dependency resolution decisions

```bash
rhema validate --use-lock-file
```

**New Validation Rules**:

- All scopes in lock file exist

- All dependencies in lock file are valid

- No circular dependencies

- Version constraints are satisfied

- Checksums match current files

### Enhanced Dependencies Command


The dependencies command will use the lock file for analysis:

```bash
rhema dependencies --from-lock-file
```

**Enhancements**:

- Accurate dependency impact analysis

- Version conflict detection

- Dependency chain visualization

- Performance optimization using pre-computed graph

### CI/CD Integration


Lock file generation and validation will be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml


- name: Generate Lock File
  run: rhema lock generate --strategy semantic

- name: Validate Lock File
  run: rhema lock validate --strict

- name: Commit Lock File
  run: |
    git add rhema.lock
    git commit -m "Update rhema.lock" || exit 0
```
