## Configuration


### Default Configuration


The performance monitoring system comes with sensible defaults:

```yaml
# Performance thresholds


cpu_threshold: 80.0%           # Alert when CPU > 80%
memory_threshold: 85.0%        # Alert when memory > 85%
command_execution_threshold: 5000ms  # Alert when commands > 5s
response_time_threshold: 1000ms      # Alert when response > 1s

# Collection intervals


metrics_interval: 60s          # Collect metrics every minute
report_interval: 24h           # Generate reports every 24 hours

# Storage


retention_days: 30             # Keep metrics for 30 days
```

### Custom Configuration


Create a custom configuration file:

```bash
# Copy the example configuration


cp examples/performance-config.yaml .rhema/performance-config.yaml

# Edit the configuration


nano .rhema/performance-config.yaml
```

Example custom configuration:

```yaml
# Development environment (lower thresholds)


thresholds:
  cpu_threshold: 70.0
  memory_threshold: 80.0
  command_execution_threshold: 3000

# More frequent reporting


reporting:
  report_interval: 6  # Every 6 hours

# Shorter retention for development


storage:
  retention:
    retention_days: 7
```

## Commands Reference


### `rhema performance start`


Start performance monitoring with current configuration.

**Options:**

- `--config <file>`: Use custom configuration file

**Example:**
```bash
rhema performance start --config .rhema/performance-config.yaml
```

### `rhema performance stop`


Stop performance monitoring and save current metrics.

### `rhema performance status`


Display current system performance status with threshold alerts.

**Output includes:**

- Current CPU and memory usage

- Disk and network I/O rates

- File system performance

- Process and thread counts

- Threshold violations (if any)

### `rhema performance report`


Generate a comprehensive performance report.

**Options:**

- `--hours <number>`: Hours to include in report (default: 24)

- `--format <format>`: Output format (json, yaml, html, markdown)

**Example:**
```bash
# Generate report for last 48 hours


rhema performance report --hours 48

# Generate HTML report


rhema performance report --format html
```

### `rhema performance config`


Display current performance monitoring configuration.

## Integration Examples


### CI/CD Integration


Add performance monitoring to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/performance-check.yml


name: Performance Check
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  performance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable
      
      - name: Run Performance Tests
        run: |
          cargo test performance_monitoring_tests
          rhema performance report --hours 1 --format json
      
      - name: Upload Performance Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: performance-report
          path: performance-report.json
```

### Automated Monitoring


Set up automated performance monitoring:

```bash
#!/bin/bash


# monitor-performance.sh


# Start monitoring


rhema performance start

# Wait for some activity


sleep 3600  # 1 hour

# Generate report


rhema performance report --format html

# Check for critical issues


if rhema performance status | grep -q "CPU usage exceeds threshold"; then
    echo "WARNING: High CPU usage detected"
    # Send alert


fi

# Stop monitoring


rhema performance stop
```

### Custom Metrics Integration


Integrate with external monitoring systems:

```bash
# Export metrics in Prometheus format


rhema performance report --format prometheus > metrics.prom

# Send to monitoring system


curl -X POST http://monitoring-system:9090/api/v1/write \
  --data-binary @metrics.prom
```
