# Prompt Pattern Advanced Features


This document outlines advanced features for the prompt pattern system that should be implemented in future versions of Rhema.

## ⚠️ Critical Issue: Current Success Rate Implementation


**Problem**: The current `success_rate` field in `PromptPattern` is fundamentally flawed:

- It's a simple float without usage tracking

- No way to know how many times the prompt was used

- Can't calculate meaningful success rates without usage counts

- Manual updates don't reflect actual effectiveness

**Required Fix**: Replace with proper usage analytics:
```yaml
usage_analytics:
  total_uses: 42
  successful_uses: 35
  success_rate: 0.83  # calculated: successful_uses / total_uses
  last_used: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  feedback_history: [...]
```

**Priority**: P0 (Critical) - This should be fixed before any other advanced features.

## P1 (High Priority) - Advanced Context Injection


### Conditional Context Rules


- **Feature**: Support conditional context injection based on task type, file type, or other criteria

- **Implementation**: Add `context_rules` field to `PromptPattern` struct

- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  context_rules:

    - condition: "task_type == 'code_review'"
      context_files: ["patterns.yaml", "knowledge.yaml"]
      injection_method: "prepend"

    - condition: "file_type == 'test'"
      context_files: ["patterns.yaml"]
      injection_method: "template_variable"
  ```

### Multi-File Context Support


- **Feature**: Load and merge context from multiple files

- **Implementation**: Support array of context files in injection rules

- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  context_files: ["patterns.yaml", "knowledge.yaml", "decisions.yaml"]
  ```

### Context Priority System


- **Feature**: Define priority when multiple context rules match

- **Implementation**: Add `priority` field to context rules

- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  context_rules:

    - condition: "task_type == 'bug_fix'"
      priority: 1
      context_files: ["knowledge.yaml"]

    - condition: "task_type == 'bug_fix' && severity == 'high'"
      priority: 2
      context_files: ["knowledge.yaml", "patterns.yaml"]
  ```

## P2 (Medium Priority) - Enhanced Metrics and Feedback


### Detailed Feedback System


- **Feature**: Store detailed feedback for each prompt usage

- **Implementation**: Add `feedback_history` field to `PromptPattern`

- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  feedback_history:

    - timestamp: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
      rating: 4
      feedback: "Great for code reviews, but could be more specific about security concerns"
      context: "Rust code review with security focus"
  ```

### Usage Analytics


- **Feature**: Track usage patterns and success rates over time

- **Implementation**: Add `usage_count`, `last_used`, and `success_rate_history` fields

- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  usage_count: 42
  last_used: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  success_rate_history:

    - date: "2025-01-01"
      rate: 0.75

    - date: "2025-01-15"
      rate: 0.85
  ```

## P3 (Low Priority) - Advanced Template Features


### Template Variables Beyond Context


- **Feature**: Support custom template variables beyond `{{CONTEXT}}`

- **Implementation**: Add `variables` field to `PromptPattern`

- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  template: "Review this {{LANGUAGE}} code: {{CONTEXT}}"
  variables:
    LANGUAGE: "Rust"
  ```

### Template Versioning


- **Feature**: Track prompt template evolution over time

- **Implementation**: Add `version` and `template_history` fields

- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  version: "2.1.0"
  template_history:

    - version: "1.0.0"
      template: "Please review this code: {{CONTEXT}}"
      date: "2024-12-01"

    - version: "2.0.0"
      template: "Review this {{LANGUAGE}} code: {{CONTEXT}}"
      date: "2025-01-01"
  ```

### Template Inheritance


- **Feature**: Allow prompts to inherit from base templates

- **Implementation**: Add `extends` field to reference other prompt patterns

- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  extends: "base-code-review"
  template: "{{BASE_TEMPLATE}}\n\nAdditional security checks: {{SECURITY_CONTEXT}}"
  ```

## P4 (Future) - AI-Powered Features

**Note**: AI-powered features have been moved to a separate proposal: [0028-ai-powered-prompt-optimization.md](0028-ai-powered-prompt-optimization.md)

The AI-powered features include:
- Automatic success rate optimization
- Intelligent context selection  
- Prompt pattern recommendations
- Natural language prompt generation
- Adaptive learning systems

See the dedicated AI proposal for detailed implementation plans, architecture, and timeline.

## Implementation Notes


### Backward Compatibility


- All new fields should be optional to maintain backward compatibility

- Default values should be provided for new fields

- Migration tools should be provided for existing prompt patterns

### Performance Considerations


- Context loading should be cached to avoid repeated file I/O

- Feedback history should be limited to prevent unbounded growth

- Template variable substitution should be efficient

### User Experience


- Advanced features should be opt-in and not overwhelm basic users

- Clear documentation and examples should be provided

- Interactive builders should support both basic and advanced modes

## Success Metrics


### Technical Metrics


- **Context Relevance**: 90%+ accuracy in context selection

- **Performance**: Sub-100ms context injection

- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for prompt pattern services

### User Experience Metrics


- **Adoption**: 70% of users adopt advanced features within 6 months

- **Satisfaction**: 85%+ user satisfaction with advanced features

- **Effectiveness**: 40% improvement in prompt effectiveness with advanced features

### Business Metrics
