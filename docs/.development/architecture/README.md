# Rhema Development Architecture

This directory contains development-focused architectural documentation, including proposals, design decisions, and technical specifications for Rhema's development process.

## üèóÔ∏è Development Architecture Contents

### üìã Design Proposals

- **[Proposals](./proposals/)** - RFC-style proposals for new features, architectural changes, and enhancements

  - Each proposal follows a standardized format with clear problem statements, solutions, and implementation details
  - Proposals are numbered sequentially and include comprehensive analysis
  - Status tracking and priority management for development planning

## üìù Proposal Process

Proposals in this directory follow a structured process:

### 1. Problem Statement
- Clear definition of the issue or opportunity
- Context and background information
- Stakeholder impact analysis

### 2. Solution Design
- Detailed technical approach
- Architecture diagrams and flowcharts
- Technology stack considerations
- Integration patterns and APIs

### 3. Implementation Plan
- Step-by-step execution strategy
- Timeline and milestone planning
- Resource requirements and dependencies
- Risk mitigation strategies

### 4. Impact Analysis
- Benefits and value proposition
- Risks and trade-offs assessment
- Performance implications
- Backward compatibility considerations

### 5. Review Process
- How feedback is collected and incorporated
- Stakeholder review requirements
- Approval workflow and decision criteria
- Implementation tracking and metrics

### 6. Implementation and Completion
- Development and testing phases
- Integration with existing systems
- Performance validation and optimization
- Documentation and user guides

### 7. Promotion to Production Documentation
When proposals are completed and implemented, they are promoted to production documentation:

#### 7.1 Aggregation by Theme
- **Identify Themes**: Group completed proposals by architectural themes (e.g., MCP, Lock File System, etc.)
- **Create Documentation Directories**: Establish `docs/src/docs/architecture/<theme-name>/` directories
- **Split Large Topics**: Break down sizable themes into multiple focused Markdown files

#### 7.2 Documentation Structure
- **Main README**: Overview and architecture summary for each theme
- **Detailed Documentation**: Split into focused files covering specific aspects:
  - Protocol specifications and implementation details
  - Configuration and usage guides
  - Integration examples and troubleshooting
  - Performance tuning and optimization

#### 7.3 Archive Process
- **Move Original Proposals**: Relocate completed proposals to `docs/.development/architecture/proposals/.archived/`
- **Update References**: Ensure all cross-references are updated to point to new documentation locations
- **Maintain History**: Preserve original proposal context while providing production-ready documentation

#### 7.4 Quality Assurance
- **Technical Review**: Ensure documentation accuracy and completeness
- **User Experience**: Verify clarity and usability of documentation
- **Integration Testing**: Confirm all examples and configurations work correctly
- **Performance Validation**: Document performance characteristics and optimization strategies
