# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration

**Proposal**: Integrate RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities into Rhema to transform it from a structured context management system into an intelligent, proactive knowledge assistant that can understand and surface relevant information based on semantic understanding.

## Problem Statement

While Rhema provides excellent structured context management, it currently has limitations in how AI agents interact with and discover knowledge:
- **Limited Semantic Search**: Context retrieval is based on explicit queries and file paths, not semantic understanding
- **Static Context Provision**: AI agents receive static context based on explicit queries rather than dynamic, relevant information
- **Knowledge Discovery Gaps**: Difficult to uncover hidden relationships and insights across scopes
- **Context Overload**: No intelligent filtering to prevent information overload
- **Reactive Context**: Context is retrieved reactively rather than proactively suggested

## Proposed Solution

Integrate RAG capabilities to provide semantic search, intelligent context augmentation, cross-scope knowledge discovery, proactive context suggestions, and enhanced knowledge synthesis.

## Core Components

### A. RAG Service Architecture
```rust
// New RAG service module
pub struct RAGService {
    embedding_model: EmbeddingModel,
    vector_store: VectorStore,
    context_provider: Arc<ContextProvider>,
    knowledge_synthesizer: Arc<KnowledgeSynthesizer>,
}

impl RAGService {
    // Generate embeddings for all context data
    pub async fn index_context(&self, scope: &Scope) -> Result<(), Error> {
        let knowledge = self.context_provider.get_knowledge(scope).await?;
        let decisions = self.context_provider.get_decisions(scope).await?;
        let patterns = self.context_provider.get_patterns(scope).await?;
        
        // Create embeddings for each entry
        for entry in &knowledge.entries {
            let embedding = self.embedding_model.embed(&entry.content).await?;
            self.vector_store.store(&entry.id, &embedding, entry).await?;
        }
        // ... similar for other context types
    }
    
    // Semantic search across all context
    pub async fn search_context(&self, query: &str) -> Result<Vec<ContextResult>, Error> {
        let query_embedding = self.embedding_model.embed(query).await?;
        let similar_contexts = self.vector_store.search(&query_embedding, 10).await?;
        
        // Combine with structured data for hybrid results
        Ok(similar_contexts)
    }
}
```

### B. Enhanced AI Service with RAG
```rust
// Enhanced AI service with RAG integration
impl AIService {
    pub async fn process_request_with_rag(&self, request: AIRequest) -> RhemaResult<AIResponse> {
        // Retrieve relevant context using RAG
        let relevant_context = self.rag_service.search_context(&request.prompt).await?;
        
        // Augment the prompt with retrieved context
        let augmented_prompt = self.augment_prompt_with_context(&request.prompt, &relevant_context)?;
        
        // Process with AI model
        let response = self.call_ai_api_with_prompt(&augmented_prompt).await?;
        
        // Store the context used for provenance
        self.store_context_usage(&request.id, &relevant_context).await?;
        
        Ok(response)
    }
}
```

### C. Cross-Scope Knowledge Discovery
```rust
// Cross-scope RAG service
pub struct CrossScopeRAGService {
    global_vector_store: VectorStore,
    scope_manager: Arc<ScopeManager>,
}

impl CrossScopeRAGService {
    pub async fn discover_related_context(&self, query: &str, current_scope: &str) -> Result<Vec<CrossScopeResult>, Error> {
        // Search across all scopes
        let global_results = self.global_vector_store.search(query).await?;
        
        // Filter and rank by relevance to current scope
        let relevant_results = self.rank_by_scope_relevance(&global_results, current_scope).await?;
        
        // Group by scope and provide context
        Ok(self.group_by_scope(&relevant_results))
    }
}
```

### D. Proactive Context Suggestions
```rust
// Proactive context service
pub struct ProactiveContextService {
    rag_service: Arc<RAGService>,
    file_watcher: Arc<FileWatcher>,
}

impl ProactiveContextService {
    pub async fn suggest_context_for_file(&self, file_path: &str) -> Result<Vec<ContextSuggestion>, Error> {
        // Analyze file content to understand context
        let file_context = self.analyze_file_context(file_path).await?;
        
        // Find relevant knowledge, patterns, decisions
        let suggestions = self.rag_service.search_context(&file_context).await?;
        
        // Rank and filter suggestions
        Ok(self.rank_suggestions(&suggestions))
    }
}
```

rhema rag optimize                           # Optimize vector store
rhema rag reindex --force                    # Force reindex all data
rhema rag metrics                            # Show RAG performance metrics
