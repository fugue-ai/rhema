# Enhanced Validation & Compliance

**Proposal**: Extend Rhema's validation system from basic schema validation to comprehensive business rules, compliance frameworks, and advanced validation capabilities for enterprise deployments.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **Basic Schema Validation**: Current validation is limited to JSON schema compliance
- **No Business Rules**: No support for domain-specific business rule validation
- **Missing Compliance Frameworks**: No built-in support for industry compliance standards
- **Limited Cross-Validation**: No validation across multiple scopes or relationships
- **No Risk Assessment**: No automated risk assessment or security validation
- **Static Validation Rules**: Validation rules cannot be dynamically updated or customized
- **No Testing Integration**: No integration with comprehensive testing frameworks
- **Limited Verification**: Basic validation without systematic verification methodologies

### Business Impact
- **Compliance Risks**: Manual compliance checking is error-prone and time-consuming
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: No automated security validation or risk assessment
- **Quality Issues**: Lack of business rule validation leads to configuration errors
- **Audit Challenges**: Difficult to demonstrate compliance during audits
- **Operational Risks**: Configuration errors can lead to system failures or security breaches

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach
Extend the current validation system to include:
1. **Business Rules Engine**: Domain-specific validation rules and constraints
2. **Compliance Framework Integration**: Built-in support for industry standards
3. **Cross-Scope Validation**: Validation across multiple scopes and relationships
4. **Risk Assessment Engine**: Automated security and risk validation
5. **Dynamic Validation Rules**: Configurable and updatable validation rules

### Key Components
- **Business Rules Engine**: Domain-specific validation logic
- **Compliance Framework**: Industry standard compliance validation
- **Cross-Validation System**: Multi-scope validation capabilities
- **Risk Assessment Engine**: Security and risk analysis
- **Dynamic Rule Management**: Configurable validation rules

## Core Components

#### Dynamic Rule Implementation
```rust
impl DynamicRuleManager {

        for source in &self.rule_sources {
            let rules = self.load_rules_from_source(source)?;
            self.add_rules(rules, source.priority);
        }
        
        // Validate and resolve conflicts
        self.validate_rules()?;
        self.resolve_conflicts()?;
        
        Ok(())
    }
